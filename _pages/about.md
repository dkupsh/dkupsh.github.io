I am a PhD student in Computer Science at UCLA. I research in the PolyArchitecture Research Group with [Prof. Tony Nowatzki](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~tjn/) and am broadly interested in Computer Architecture and Compiler Design.

During my undergrad, I researched in the UCSB ArchLab, under [Prof. Tim Sherwood](https://www.arch.cs.ucsb.edu/prof-sherwood), on implementing matrix functionality into [PyRTL](https://ucsbarchlab.github.io/PyRTL/) (a python-based HDL).
